# 4D-shutterstock

## Overview ‚ú®
------

This app was created as part of a multi-discipline hackathon event in association with BrainStation and Shutterstock.

My team and I were presented with an open question/challenge whereby we were to analyze the Shutterstock business model/platform and determine how they could develop a competitive advantage.

The proposal which we presented determined that currently shutterstock is heavilyused as a photo resource but not as much for the actual creation process. As such we began to create an editing environment in line with what is offered by figma. Additionallly we proposed that the platform could act as an environment for users to host their portfolios.

## Noteworthy Languages Frameworks Modules üìÅ
